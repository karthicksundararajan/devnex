# Project Progress: Devnex Client

## Current Status
- Core architecture established
- Basic node components implemented
- Services for state management in place
- Initial visualization capabilities working

## Working Features
1. **Node Components**:
   - PositionNodeComponent (draggable)
   - ResizableNodeComponent
   - ToolbarNodeComponent
   - SizeNodeComponent
2. **Services**:
   - FlowStoreService
   - NodeService
   - DBModelGeneratorService
3. **Visualization**:
   - Basic diagram rendering

## Remaining Work
1. **Components**:
   - Additional node types
   - Enhanced interaction patterns
2. **Services**:
   - More robust state management
   - Additional model generation features
3. **Visualization**:
   - Improved performance

## Known Issues
- Documentation needs completion
- Some component specs need implementation
- Edge cases in node interactions

## Evolution
- Initial commit shows focus on core visualization
- Progressing toward full schema modeling
- Moving from basic to advanced features
